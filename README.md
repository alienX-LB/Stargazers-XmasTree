# Stargazers-XmasTree
Python program which you can execute in a local folder containing your selected better images (in jpg or png format). The program will generate the animated gif image of a Christmas Tree featuring a random selection of your images in the decoration balls. This was created with the aim to use astronomical images, but you can use with any image type you prefer. Enjoy!
